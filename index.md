## About Me

I am **Wenbo (Vito) Zhu**, Founding AI Lead & Head of AI Research at **[OpusClip](https://www.opusclip.com)**, where I lead a 20-person AI team focusing on multimodal video understanding, generative video editing, and agentic systems.  
I closely work with **Prof. Xu Yang** and have guided several interns, including **Yongliang Wu** and **Bozheng Li**.  

Previously, I was a Senior ML Engineer at **ByteDance/TikTok**, one of the founding engineers behind **Gauthmath**, mainly repsonsible for building the world’s first AI-based geometry solver.  
Earlier in my career, as a Research Scientist at **Cloudwalk Technology**, I built a **billion-scale face clustering engine** deployed in 10+ cities (now patented).

Both **OpusClip** and **Gauthmath** were recognized by *Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)* as **Top 50 GenAI Apps**.  

I hold a **Master (OR)** from **UC Berkeley**, and an **Undergrad (IE & Math)** from **Beihang University**.

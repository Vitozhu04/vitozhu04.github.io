## About Me

Hello! I'm **Wenbo (Vito) Zhu**, currently the **Founding AI Lead & Head of AI Research** at [OpusClip](https://www.opusclip.com).  
I joined when the team had around 5 engineers, failed and pivoted, and now lead a **30+ cross-functional AI team** delivering next-generation multimodal and generative video products.  
I initiated, led, and shipped several flagship systems, including:  
- [**OpusClip**](https://www.opus.pro/) – No.1 AI Clipping Tool in the market
- [**ClipAnything**](https://www.opus.pro/clipanything) – First multi-modal clipping tool with prompting capabilities
- [**Agent Opus**](https://www.opus.pro/agent) – First video agent tailored for social media

Before OpusClip, I was a **Senior ML Engineer at ByteDance/TikTok**, where I served as a founding engineer of [Gauthmath](https://www.gauthmath.com/) — building the world’s first AI-based geometry solver with 100M+ downloads.  
Earlier, as a **Research Scientist at Cloudwalk Technology**, I developed a **billion-scale face clustering engine** deployed across 10+ cities (patented).  

Both **OpusClip** and **Gauthmath** were recognized by *Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)* as **Top 50 GenAI Apps**.  

🎓 I hold a **Master (OR)** from [UC Berkeley](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/) and an **Undergrad (IE & Math)** from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/).

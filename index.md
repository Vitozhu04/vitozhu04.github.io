## About Me

Hello! I'm **Wenbo (Vito) Zhu**, currently the **Founding AI Lead & Head of AI Research** at [OpusClip](https://www.opusclip.com), where I lead a 20-person AI team focusing on multimodal video understanding, generative video editing, and agentic systems.  
I’m fortunate to work closely with [Prof. Xu Yang](https://yxpalmweb.github.io/), and have mentored multiple interns including [Yongliang Wu](https://yongliang-wu.github.io/) and Bozheng Li.  

Before OpusClip, I was a **Senior ML Engineer at ByteDance/TikTok**, where I served as a founding engineer of [Gauthmath](https://www.gauthmath.com/) — building the world’s first AI-based geometry solver with 100M+ downloads.  
Earlier, as a **Research Scientist at Cloudwalk Technology**, I developed a **billion-scale face clustering engine** deployed across 10+ cities (patented).  

Both **OpusClip** and **Gauthmath** were recognized by *Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)* as **Top 50 GenAI Apps**.  

🎓 I hold a **Master (OR)** from [UC Berkeley](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/) and an **Undergrad (IE & Math)** from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/).
